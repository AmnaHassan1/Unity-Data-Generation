# Unity-Data-Generation
Data generation using Unity's Perception package for instance segmentation.

Project description: We will build a model and train it using artificial data generated using the game engine unity. Specifically, the data will be generated by the unity package Perception, and the task of the model will be instance segmentation. The  model will be tested on real data to measure its effectiveness, and evaluate the quality of the generated data. We will continuously adjust both the model and the artificial data to improve the accuracy.
